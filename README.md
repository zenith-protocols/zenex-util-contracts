# Zenex Util Contracts

Small standalone contracts for Zenex, a perpetual futures exchange on
[Stellar](https://stellar.org) (Soroban). They sit outside the core protocol in
[zenex-contracts](https://github.com/zenith-protocols/zenex-contracts) and do not
depend on its interfaces.

## Contracts

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `referral` | Referral attestation: a wallet attests which wallet referred it |
| `session-policy` | Smart-account policy for session keys: a contract allowlist and one allowed transfer destination |

`session-policy` is not safe to deploy: its transfer-destination guard is bypassable (unrestricted
`approve`, muxed `to` addresses, the router's fee envelope). Kept for the testnet record; must be
rewritten before any mainnet use.

### Referral

`attribute(caller: Address, referrer: Address) -> (Address, Address)` requires `caller`'s
authorization and fails with `ReferralError::SelfReferral` (1) when `caller == referrer`. It emits
`Attributed { referee, referrer }` with topics `("attributed", referee, referrer)`, so indexers can
filter on either side, and returns `(caller, referrer)` for simulation pre-flight. The event log is
the record: the contract has no storage, no admin and no constructor.

## Getting Started

Install Rust through [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and the
[Stellar CLI 27.1.0 release binary](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/releases/tag/v27.1.0)
on `PATH`.

Run commands from the repository root. Rustup installs Rust 1.98.1 and the
`wasm32v1-none` target from `rust-toolchain.toml`. Make targets use the committed
lockfile; dependency changes must update it explicitly.

Build the contracts with:

```
make
```

Run the unit tests with:

```
make test
```

## Deployment

`make` writes optimized WASM to `target/wasm32v1-none/release/`.

`make release` builds the release WASMs into `wasm/` from a clean checkout and embeds the
checked-out commit as the `source_commit` contract meta. Commit the output in the next commit. No
release has been cut from this workspace yet.

| Contract | Testnet address | Deployed wasm sha256 |
|---|---|---|
| session-policy | CDUUHEXJY3EMQPGGRQS2KVJN7J3RM5HM2QWVUA5AGE3BRUOYW2MZPUAT | a98d1317f918b03af4e23f407eb99711eabda9c64629ae413427e7fa1c4f2135 |
| referral | CAVUAS7CMIXOUXFND77EDNB5OOWBAM4AOAGV4NF6D4JQXAZAAERQDJQQ | 2d459a2180d91b5006ac0154cd97c4f4505165b39971ace0e534c3e549c5dc9d |

The testnet contracts were built from the legacy local sources
(`soroban-smart-account/session-policy` @ 9cded45 and `soroban-referral`), which reproduce the
deployed wasm byte-for-byte with rustc 1.93.1, stellar CLI 25.2.0 and their original lockfiles.
This workspace builds with soroban-sdk 26 and one shared lockfile, so its output does not match
those hashes. The contract functions and their argument types are unchanged.
